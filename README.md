Abstract: A three-dimensional dynamic model for simulating various motions of two-wheel-steering vehicles is presented. The model has 16 independent degrees of freedom (DOF) that consist of three components: a vehicle body of six DOF, four independent suspensions mounted at every corner of the car body, and four tyre models linked with each suspension. The dynamic equations are represented in six coordinate frames: world-fixed coordinate, vehicle-fixed coordinate, and four wheel-fixed coordinate frames. Then these equations lead to the approximated prediction model of vehicle posture. Both lateral and longitudinal dynamics can be computed simultaneously under the conditions of which various inputs including steering command, driving torque, gravity, rolling resistance of tyre, aerodynamic resistance, etc., are considered. This full vehicle model is implemented in a MATLABÂ® toolbox and then is validated through experiments. It is also shown through simulation examples that the full vehicle model can be easily used for the performance analysis of the guidance controller as well as the dynamic motion analysis of the vehicle.
