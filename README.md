 Abstract: Athree-dimensional dynamicmodelforsimulatingvariousmotionsof
 two-wheel-steering vehicles is presented. The model has 16 independent degrees
 of freedom (DOF) that consist of three components: a vehicle body of 6 DOF,
 4 independent suspensions mounted at every corner of the car body, and 4 tire
 models linked with each suspension. The dynamic equations are represented in
 six coordinate frames: world-fixed coordinate, vehicle-fixed coordinate, and four
 wheel-fixed coordinate frames. Then these equations lead to the approximated
 predictionmodelofvehicleposture.Bothlateralandlongitudinaldynamicscanbe
 computed simultaneously under the conditions of which various inputs including
 steering command, driving torque, gravity, rolling resistance of tire, aerodynamic
 resistance, etc. are considered. This full vehicle model is implemented in a
 Matlab toolbox and then is validated through experiments. It is also shown
 through simulation examples that the full vehicle model can be easily used for the
 performance analysis of the guidance controller as well as the dynamic motion
 analysis of the vehicle.

 Keywords: vehicle dynamics; three-dimensional modeling; automatic guidance
 control; full vehicle model.
